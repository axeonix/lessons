# 03-May-2025: Trusting in God's Timing (Numbers 20:10–12)

**Opening Prayer**

## TRUST GOD’S TIMING – He Is In Control & His Timing Is Always Perfect

“Have you ever asked God, ‘Why not now?’” Many of us have prayed, waited, and wrestled with silence. We question, we wonder, but today, God wants to remind us: His timing is always perfect.

## Moses: A lesson in partial obedience

**Numbers 20:10–12:**
> He and Aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and Moses said to them, “Listen, you rebels, must we bring you water out of this rock?” 11 Then Moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff. Water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank. 12 But the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this community into the land I give them.”

- Moses disobeys God by striking the rock instead of speaking to it. Moses, the great leader, was denied entry into the Promised Land—not because of lack of work, but because of disobedience and pride. Delayed obedience is still disobedience. And disobedience delays destiny.
- There is Light and There is Darkness, There is Holiness and there is un-holiness. There is Righteousness and there is un-righteousness. There is Pride or there is humility. More times than not we need to do self-assessments. We need to assess whether we are hot or cold for The Things of God.


## Know who God really is

**Many create their own image of God in their minds — but we must align our view of God with what His Word declares:**

### He is Holy:
**1 Peter 1:16** 
> As it is written: ‘Be holy, because I am holy.’

- This powerful verse is a direct quotation from **Leviticus 11:44**, and it serves as a clear and non-negotiable command for every believer: to pursue holiness as a reflection of God’s own character.

### He is Just:
**Deuteronomy 32:3–4** 
> I will proclaim the name of the Lord. Oh, praise the greatness of our God! 4 He is the Rock, his works are perfect, and all his ways are just.

- A faithful God who does no wrong, upright and just is he.

### He is Merciful and Loving:
**Psalm 145:8**
> The Lord is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger and rich in love.

- This verse gives us a beautiful and reassuring glimpse into the heart of God. It’s a declaration of His character, especially in how He relates to us...His people. "The Lord is gracious and compassionate"  Gracious – God extends favor that we do not earn or deserve. He gives generously, not because of who we are, but because of who He is. 
- Compassionate – God feels our pain. He is moved by our suffering. His heart is not distant or cold — it is warm, engaged, and overflowing with care. God’s grace lifts us; His compassion holds us.


### He is the Judge of All:
**Psalm 7:8**
> Let the LORD judge the peoples; vindicate me, O LORD, according to my righteousness and integrity." 

- This verse expresses a plea to God to judge justly, siding with the speaker's righteousness and integrity, rather than with their enemies. It highlights a trust in God's righteousness and his ability to uphold the just.


### He is King of Kings:
**Revelation 19:16**
> On his robe and on his thigh he has this name written: KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.

- This powerful verse comes from one of the most dramatic scenes in Scripture — the triumphant return of Jesus Christ at His Second Coming. It reveals not only who Jesus is, but also the authority He carries as He returns to establish His eternal kingdom.
- “King of Kings and Lord of Lords” This title reveals Jesus as the supreme ruler over all kings, presidents, prime ministers, and powers — both earthly and spiritual. No one compares. No throne rivals His. His authority is absolute and final. We don’t get to redefine God; we must re-align with Him.


## Belief means Obedience

**John 3:16:**
> For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

- But what does it mean to “believe”? **John 14:15** “If you love me, keep my commands.” John 8:31 – “If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples.”
- Belief is not just words; it is lifestyle. It is surrender. Even demons believe and they are terribly frightened by God and His Son Jesus Christ of Nazareth. Belief is not enough, we need to obey God's Commands.

**James 2:19:**
> You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder.


## Trusting through the silence

- Sometimes we pray and hear… nothing. We wait, and it feels like God forgot us. “Lord, are you even listening?”
- It’s not about how fast we get the answer—it’s about trusting God's purpose while we wait. Even unanswered prayers serve a divine purpose and remember if God says no, that is still an answer even though we may not like it.

### Let's take a look at Joseph. 

**Genesis 37:18–36:**
> But they saw him in the distance, and before he reached them, they plotted to kill him. 19 “Here comes that dreamer!” they said to each other. 20 “Come now, let’s kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him. Then we’ll see what comes of his dreams.” 21 When Reuben heard this, he tried to rescue him from their hands. “Let’s not take his life,” he said. 22 “Don’t shed any blood. Throw him into this cistern here in the wilderness, but don’t lay a hand on him.” Reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father. 23 So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe—the ornate robe he was wearing— 24 and they took him and threw him into the cistern. The cistern was empty; there was no water in it. 25 As they sat down to eat their meal, they looked up and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead. Their camels were loaded with spices, balm and myrrh, and they were on their way to take them down to Egypt. 26 Judah said to his brothers, “What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? 27 Come, let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him; after all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.” His brothers agreed. 28 So when the Midianite merchants came by, his brothers pulled Joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels[a] of silver to the Ishmaelites, who took him to Egypt. 29 When Reuben returned to the cistern and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes. 30 He went back to his brothers and said, “The boy isn’t there! Where can I turn now?” 31 Then they got Joseph’s robe, slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood. 32 They took the ornate robe back to their father and said, “We found this. Examine it to see whether it is your son’s robe.” 33 He recognized it and said, “It is my son’s robe! Some ferocious animal has devoured him. Joseph has surely been torn to pieces.” 34 Then Jacob tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days. 35 All his sons and daughters came to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “No,” he said, “I will continue to mourn until I join my son in the grave.” So his father wept for him. 36 Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh’s officials, the captain of the guard.

- Betrayed, sold, enslaved… then exalted. 14 years of suffering = Preparation for Purpose. God uses delays to develop, not to deny.

**Jeremiah 29:11:**
> Plans to prosper you, not to harm you…

### God is not on our schedule, we are on His 

- Isaiah 55:8–9 presents a profound reminder of the difference between God's ways and human ways, emphasizing the vast gap between divine wisdom and human understanding:

**Isaiah 55:8–9:**
> For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,” declares the Lord. 9 “As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.”

- These verses highlight the fundamental truth that God operates on a plane far beyond human comprehension. His thoughts are not limited by time, circumstance, or personal bias. Unlike human reasoning, which is often shaped by limited knowledge and flawed assumptions, God's understanding is perfect, eternal, and all-encompassing.
- Verse 8 underscores the divergence between human thinking and divine intention. It reminds us that even when we believe we understand a situation fully, God's perspective may be entirely different—and ultimately, better. Verse 9 reinforces this idea through a vivid metaphor: just as the heavens are immeasurably higher than the earth, so too are God's ways and thoughts superior to our own. This comparison stresses not just difference, but magnitude—a reminder of how far above us God's wisdom truly is. This passage calls for humility.
- It invites us to trust God's guidance, even when it contradicts our own reasoning or desires. Rather than relying solely on our limited perspective, we are urged to submit to the higher wisdom of God. In doing so, we acknowledge our dependence on Him and cultivate a posture of faith, allowing His will to shape our lives beyond what we can see or understand.
- His thoughts are higher. We want microwave miracles—God works with a master plan. God is never late. Never early. He is always on time.


### Trust in Him

**Hebrews 4:13:** 
> Everything is exposed before Him. There is no partial obedience—only obedience or disobedience. Ask: Are we truly obeying? Are we submitting to His timing?

**Proverbs 3:5-6**
> Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; 6 in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.

- “Trust in the Lord… he will make your paths straight.”
- Trust God’s heart even when you can’t trace His hand. His delays are not denials. His timing is perfect. Surrender your timeline to God today. He knows what’s best. Rest in the perfect timing of the God who sees, knows, and loves you.”


### May The Joy of The Lord be your Strength and God Bless you all in The Mighty Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
