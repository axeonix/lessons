# 07-Jun-2025: Seek the Peace of God (Matthew 5:9)

**Opening Prayer**

## Introduction

**Matthew 5:9** 
> Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God. 

**Philippians 4:7** 
> And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.

- Peace is not just a beautiful concept; it is a powerful force in the life of a believer. It is essential in our families, churches, communities, and personal walk with God. Without peace, chaos reigns. But when peace governs our hearts, homes, and relationships, we reflect the heart of God.

## Peace in the Family

**Hebrews 12:14**
> Make every effort to live in peace with everyone and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord.

- If God commands us to live in peace with everyone, how much more with those closest to us—our spouses, children, and extended family? 
- Sadly, many can relate more to strife and bitterness within their homes than peace. We often treat strangers with more grace than our own family members. **This is a tactic of the enemy.**
- Strife, discord, and bitterness are satanic tools used to destroy unity. But Jesus left us His peace: 


**John 14:27**
> Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.

- In this tender part of Jesus’ farewell message, He offers His disciples a profound and lasting gift — the gift of **peace**. 
- It is not the fragile, fleeting peace of the world, but a deep, enduring calm that comes from His presence.
- “Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you.” Jesus promises His own peace — peace that sustained Him through suffering, rejection, and even the cross. 
- It is a peace anchored in trust in the Father and not dependent on outward circumstances. “Not as the world gives do I give to you.” 
- The world offers peace through comfort, wealth, or avoidance of conflict, but these are shallow and uncertain. 
- Jesus' peace is internal, spiritual, and eternal — available even in the midst of trials,
- “Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid.” This is both a comfort and a command. Jesus tells us we don’t have to live in fear or anxiety. Through His peace, we can face the unknown with courage, knowing He is with us.
- **John 14:27** reminds us that in a chaotic and uncertain world, true peace is not found in circumstances or people, but in Christ. His peace calms our fears, quiets our hearts, and strengthens our faith. It is a gift we can receive daily, no matter what we face.


## Obstacles to Having That Peace

- Poverty and sickness can rob peace. When a man cannot provide, or a loved one is ill, peace is threatened. Yet, as seen in Job’s life, God is sovereign even in trials.
- Sin robs people of peace.

**Isaiah 26:3:** 
> You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they trust in you.

  - This verse promises that God will keep in perfect peace those who remain steadfast in mind and place their trust in Him. 
  - This verse teaches that true, lasting peace comes not from circumstances but from a firm and unwavering focus on God.

- "You will keep in perfect peace" — God is the source and sustainer of deep, complete peace, not just momentary calm.
- "Those whose minds are steadfast" — A steady, focused mind anchored in faith remains calm in trials and resists fear or doubt.
- "Because they trust in you" — Peace flows from trust—believing God is faithful, in control, and worthy of complete confidence.
- **Isaiah 26:3** encourages believers to fix their thoughts on God and trust Him fully. In doing so, they will experience the kind of peace that the world cannot give — a peace that guards the heart and mind through every storm. Jesus tells us that perfect peace is reserved for those whose minds are steadfast because they trust in God.


**Ephesians 5:15-16**
> Be very careful, then, how you live — not as unwise but as wise, making the most of every opportunity, because the days are evil.

- This verse urges believers to live wisely and purposefully, making the most of every opportunity in a world filled with moral challenges.
- "Be very careful how you live — not as unwise but as wise"
- Believers are called to live with intention, exercising godly wisdom rather than thoughtlessness. This involves careful, discerning choices that align with God’s will.
- "Making the most of every opportunity" Also translated as “redeeming the time,” this emphasizes the importance of using each moment well — seizing opportunities to do good, grow spiritually, and serve others for God's glory.
- "Because the days are evil" In a world marked by sin, temptation, and distraction, it’s even more urgent to live with focus and righteousness. 
- Evil days demand alertness and spiritual diligence. This veerse is a call to intentional, faith-filled living. It reminds us that time is precious, the world is spiritually dangerous, and every moment matters. By walking wisely and making the most of our time, we live lives that reflect Christ and advance His purposes.


## Trust in God for Peace

**Proverbs 3:5-6**
> Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight.

**Galatians 5:22-23:** 
> But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.

- The fruit of the Spirit includes peace

**Psalm 91:7** 
> A thousand may fall at your side, ten thousand at your right hand, but it will not come near you.

- Jesus, the Prince of Peace, promises protection even when thousands fall around us.  
- This verse promises that, while those around you may be affected by harm, you will be protected. It emphasizes God's sovereign protection and care for those who trust in Him. 
- In **Nehemiah 8:10**, we learn that “The Joy of the Lord is our strength.” That joy fuels our peace.


### Prayer and Peace

**Philippians 4:6-7**
> Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God… will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus."

- We must pray for our families, asking God for peace on every side.

### Peace in the Face of Trouble: The Story of Elijah 

**1 Kings 19:1-9** 
> Now Ahab told Jezebel everything Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. 2 So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah to say, “May the gods deal with me, be it ever so severely, if by this time tomorrow I do not make your life like that of one of them.”
>
> 3 Elijah was afraid and ran for his life. When he came to Beersheba in Judah, he left his servant there, 4 while he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness. He came to a broom bush, sat down under it and prayed that he might die. “I have had enough, Lord,” he said. “Take my life; I am no better than my ancestors.” 5 Then he lay down under the bush and fell asleep.
>
> All at once an angel touched him and said, “Get up and eat.” 6 He looked around, and there by his head was some bread baked over hot coals, and a jar of water. He ate and drank and then lay down again.
>
> 7 The angel of the Lord came back a second time and touched him and said, “Get up and eat, for the journey is too much for you.” 8 So he got up and ate and drank. Strengthened by that food, he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached Horeb, the mountain of God. 9 There he went into a cave and spent the night.

- Elijah fled from Jezebel, weary and fearful. After one day on his own strength, he collapsed under a broom tree. But when God fed and strengthened him, he ran 40 days and nights to Mount Horeb — 489 miles!
- On our own strength, we collapse. With God’s strength, we endure.

### Paths to Peace

- The Peace of Hope in Heaven: 
  
  **Revelation 21:3**
  > "God’s dwelling place is now among the people."

  - One day, we’ll understand all the ways God carried us. We’ll see clearly how His peace, presence, and provision protected and preserved us. All glory will go to Him.

- Love and Peace: 
  
  **Matthew 22:39**
  > "Love your neighbor as yourself."

  - Living in peace begins with loving yourself and trusting in God. Worry steals peace. **Matthew 6:25-34** reminds us to let go of worry and seek God’s kingdom first. When we do that, God takes care of the rest.


- The Call to Resist the Enemy: 
  
  **James 4:7**
  > "Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."
  - We are not called to run from the devil—but to stand firm and he will run from you. We must put on the full armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-18), every day, like soldiers preparing for battle.


- Living Like a Child of God: 

  **Matthew 5:9** says peacemakers are called children of God. That’s not just a title — it’s an identity. God is the God of peace, and if we carry His Spirit, we will live in peace with others, even our enemies (**Proverbs 16:7**).

- A Christians response in difficult situations.

  **Romans 12:17-21**
  > Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everyone. 18 If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone. 19 Do not take revenge, my dear friends, but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: “It is mine to avenge; I will repay,” says the Lord. 20 On the contrary: “If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals on his head.” 21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

  - This verse  teaches Christians how to respond to wrongdoing and hostility with godly character. Rather than retaliating, believers are called to:
  - Do what is right and not repay evil with evil.
  - Seek peace with everyone, as far as it depends on them.
  - Trust God's justice, leaving room for His judgment instead of seeking personal revenge.
  - Respond with goodness, even to enemies—demonstrating love through acts of kindness. Overcome evil with good, showing the transformative power of godly behavior.

- Living at Peace

  **2 Corinthians 13:11**
  > Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice! Strive for full restoration, encourage one another, be of one mind, live in peace. And the God of love and peace will be with you.

  - This is Paul’s final encouragement to the Corinthian believers, urging them to live in harmony and reflect God's character. He calls them to:
    - _Rejoice_ — maintain joy despite trials.
    - _Strive for restoration_ — seek reconciliation and unity within the church. Encourage and comfort one another — support each other with love and kindness.
    - _Be of one mind_ — pursue unity in faith and purpose. Live in peace—foster peaceful, forgiving relationships. The verse ends with a comforting promise: “The God of love and peace will be with you,” assuring believers that God's presence accompanies those who live in love, unity, and peace.

- Where to put our Trust

  **Psalm 146:3**
  > "Do not put your trust in princes, nor in a son of man, in whom there is no help."

  - Trust in God. Do not put your confidence in man: 
  - This verse serves as a powerful reminder not to place our ultimate trust in human leaders, no matter how powerful or influential they may seem. While leaders and people in authority may offer temporary assistance, their help is limited and cannot bring lasting salvation.
  - Human limitations: Even the most capable leaders are mortal and flawed. They cannot guarantee our safety, peace, or future.
  - False security: Trusting in people more than God leads to disappointment. Human support is fleeting, but God's provision is eternal.
  - Divine dependence: This verse calls believers to place their full confidence in God, whose power, love, and wisdom far surpass any earthly authority.
  - This verse teaches us to shift our hope from the temporary to the eternal. In a world that often exalts human power and influence, Psalm 146:3 challenges us to remember that true help, hope, and salvation come from the Lord alone.
  - When we seek peace, live in it, and carry it to others, we become more like Christ—our Prince of Peace. Let your life be a testimony of the calm assurance that comes from knowing Jesus.
  - The most famous verse referencing the "Prince of Peace" is **Isaiah 9:6**, which states, "For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace". This verse is often associated with the birth of Jesus and his role as the Messiah, the one who brings peace and salvation. 

### God Bless you all in The Mighty Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
