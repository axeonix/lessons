# 17-May-2025: Getting to Know the Power of the Holy Spirit

**Opening Prayer**

## Introduction: How Can a Person Hear the Voice of The Holy Spirit?

Let' begin with a very simple and familiar illustration from our everyday lives: electricity. Let’s think for a moment about the way electricity works. One single electric current, when channeled through different devices, produces different results. Put it through a light bulb — it gives light. Put it through a radio — it produces sound. A TV gives us images. A stove gives us heat. A sewing machine gives power to sew clothes.

What’s the point of this? All these different manifestations come from one source: **electricity**. And in the same way, the voice of Jesus — the way He speaks to us — can take different forms, but it all comes through one power: the **Holy Spirit**.

## The Holy Spirit Is the Power that Enables Us to Hear Jesus

Jesus makes this crystal clear in:

**John 14:25-26**
> All this I have spoken while still with you. But the Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.

And again in:

**John 16:12-13**
> I have much more to say to you, more than you can now bear. But when He, the Spirit of truth, comes, He will guide you into all truth...



## So How Does the Holy Spirit Work in Our Lives?

- Without the Holy Spirit, we’re like a disconnected light bulb. The potential is there — but there’s no light. 
- We’re like a sewing machine unplugged — made for a purpose, but powerless to move. 
- It's the Holy Spirit who connects us to the living voice of Jesus. Without Him, even the Bible can feel like dry words. With Him, those words become alive. 

Let us look now at different ways the Holy Spirit may choose to work in our lives.

### The Holy Spirit Speaks Through People

- Another way God speaks is **through the lives of others**. 
- Maybe you’re someone who doesn’t read the Bible — but then God places someone in your workplace, your family, or your community. They live differently. They speak with peace, act with patience, and love deeply.
- And little by little, the Holy Spirit begins to whisper through their life: “There’s something more. There’s something you’re missing.” 
- You may even feel annoyed or convicted around them — but you can’t escape the message. 
- That’s the Holy Spirit using their life to speak to your heart. And to those of us who already follow Jesus: You might be the only Bible someone ever reads. What is your life saying about Jesus? 


### The Holy Spirit Speaks Through Crisis

- Sometimes the voice of Jesus comes through crisis: 
  - A car wreck
  - a diagnosis
  - a divorce
  - a failure. 
- You walk away from a crash without a scratch—and suddenly, you realize, “I could’ve died. Why am I still here?” 
- In a moment of loss or heartbreak, you come face-to-face with your needs. Your limits. Your loneliness. 
- In that moment, Jesus is speaking. A wise person once said: 

>“Man’s disappointments are God’s appointments.” 

- That closed door might just be His invitation to hear His voice. 
- How can a person hear the voice of Jesus? You hear it through the Power of the Holy Spirit. Through Scripture, when it comes alive. Through the life of another believer. Through a crisis that drives you to your knees.
- But none of these ways work unless you're connected to the Source. The Holy Spirit is not optional — He is essential. 
- Ask yourselves these questions:
  - Are you plugged in? 
  - Are you connected to the current of the Holy Spirit? 
- If not, ask Him today. Invite the Holy Spirit to speak to you. Because when He does, you won’t just hear a sound — you’ll hear the voice of the living Jesus. 

### God Is in Control

- The passage of **Hebrews 13:5-6** in many Bible translations, encourages readers to avoid the love of money and be content with what they have
- It sites God's promise of never leaving or forsaking them. 
- This leads to a bold assurance of faith and the statement, "The Lord is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?"
- No matter your current situation, no matter your suffering, stress, or fear — God is in control. **Hebrews 13:5-6** is not just a reminder—it’s a **promise**.
- God Knows You and Loves You Deeply: He knows your name (**Isaiah 43:1**).
- He knows your pain, your desires, your burdens. 
- Close your eyes and imagine God whispering to you: “I love you. I love you. You are mine. You belong to Me.” 
- That is not emotionalism; that's the truth. God’s love is not like human love — temporary and conditional. It is everlasting, immeasurable, and personal. 

### God Is With You in Every Storm

Jesus was in the boat during the storm (**Mark 4:36–41**), yet the disciples feared. Like them, we sometimes panic, forgetting who’s with us. But Jesus, calm in the storm, simply said: “Peace, be still!”

- Let me tell you If Jesus is in your boat, you will not sink. 
- If God is in control, your storm will not defeat you. He was with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the fiery furnace.

**Daniel 3:25**
> He said, “Look! I see four men walking around in the fire, unbound and unharmed, and the fourth looks like a son of the gods.”


### God’s Presence Removes Fear

**Hebrews 13:6**
> The Lord is my helper, I will not fear what man shall do unto me...

- This passage from **Hebrews 13**. It expresses faith and reliance on God's support, suggesting that one can overcome fear and adversity because of God's presence and protection. 
- Why do we fear men? Finances? Death? Rejection? 
- We fear because we forget who is in control. 
- David said, “Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil...” (**Psalm 23:4**).


Why? Because God is with him. You can go through anything if you know God is with you. 


### Your Troubles Are Small in Light of Eternity

A New Heaven and a New Earth: 

**Revelation 21:1-4**
> Then I saw “a new heaven and a new earth,” for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and there was no longer any sea. 2 I saw the Holy City, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband. 3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, “Look! God’s dwelling place is now among the people, and he will dwell with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. 4 ‘He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death’ or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away.”


- A New Heaven. No more pain. No more sorrow. No more death. God wipes every tear. That is your eternal reality if you are in Christ. 
- What is today's problem when compared to eternal joy?


### God Can Turn Every Situation Around

Think of Job — cut down like a tree, but sprouted again (**Job 14:7–9**). Esther & the Jews — destined for annihilation, but God reversed the decree. The wedding at Cana — shame was coming, but Jesus turned water into wine.

Whatever seems hopeless—it’s not over. 

**Jeremiah 32:27**
> I am the Lord, the God of all flesh: is there anything too hard for me? 


### Joy Comes From Knowing God Is in Control

The Holy Spirit is not just a helper — He’s your source of joy. 

**Nehemiah 8:10**
> The joy of the Lord is your strength.

**Psalm 16:11**
> In thy presence is fullness of joy...

- Material joy fades. People fail. Circumstances change. But joy from the Holy Spirit stands, even in sorrow.
- Guard Your Joy — Let the Holy Spirit Lead: Joy is a fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23). 
- The Holy Spirit Comforts, Guides, Convicts, Helps, Intercedes and Sanctifies!
- He is not just a feeling or a force. He is a Person — God with you.


### Do Not Give Up — God Is in Control

If you feel overwhelmed, remember: 

**Hebrews 13:5**
> Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said, “Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.

**Deuteronomy 31:6**
> Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them, for the LORD your God goes with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you.

- That’s not a poetic verse. That’s a binding promise from the One who rules heaven and earth. You are not forsaken. 
- You are not alone. You are not defeated. God is in control.


### God Bless you all in The Mighty Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
