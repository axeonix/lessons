# 24-May-2025: Be One With the Holy Spirit

**Opening Prayer**

## How To Develop a Closer Relationship With The Holy Spirit

**Matthew 4:4**
> Jesus answered, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.’

- The saying "man does not live by bread alone" is a quote from The Bible, specifically from **Matthew 4:4**. 
- It means that people need more than just basic necessities like food to live a meaningful and fulfilling life. 
- They also require things like love, relationships, purpose, and a connection to something greater than themselves. 
- The phrase emphasizes the importance of spiritual nourishment and **The Word of God**. 
- In the context of The Bible, it was a response to the devil's temptation of Jesus in the wilderness, where Jesus was asked to turn stones into bread.
- Jesus rejected this temptation, stating that true sustenance comes from The **Word of God*. 
- The saying is often used to encourage people to consider the broader aspects of life beyond their immediate needs. 
- It suggests that finding purpose and meaning is crucial for a fulfilling existence.
- You see The Bible is a Spiritual Book and without The Holy Spirit you will never be able to understand The Bible because The Holy Bible has nothing to do with how smart you are or your intellect. **It has everything to do with your spirit**. Without The Holy Spirit it won't have the same effect as someone with The Holy Spirit.

**2 Timothy 3:16**
> “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.”

- This single verse from the Apostle Paul to Timothy is one of the most powerful declarations about the nature and purpose of the Bible. 
- It speaks not only to the authority of Scripture but also to its function in the life of every believer. 
- If is **"God-breathed"** – The Divine Origin of Scripture: The Greek word used here is “theopneustos”, which literally means “God-breathed.” This doesn’t just mean that God influenced the writing—it means:  **He is the source of it**. 
- The Bible is not just a historical record or a collection of moral teachings; it is the very voice of God in written form. When we open Scripture, we are not reading man’s opinion — we are encountering the mind, heart, and will of Almighty God. 
- The Bible is God-breathed, it carries divine authority. To ignore it is to ignore God Himself.

Do you want to hear The Voice of God? Read His Word, The Holy Bible. Do you want God to hear what you want to say to Him? Get on your knees and Pray to Him. He will listen. “God’s Ears Are Attentive”:

- The phrase “God’s ears are attentive” signifies that God is actively listening to and paying close attention to the prayers and cries of those who seek Him. 
- This concept is deeply rooted in Scripture, offering comfort and assurance to believers that their voices are heard by a compassionate and responsive God.

The idea of God's attentiveness is emphasized throughout both the Old and New Testaments:

**Psalm 34:15**
> “The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are attentive to their cry.” 

- This verse portrays a God who is watchful and deeply concerned with the well-being of His people. 

Similarly:

**1 Peter 3:12**
> “For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are attentive to their prayer.” 

- These passages affirm that God is not distant or indifferent but intimately engaged in the lives of His followers.
- This theme reveals God’s personal involvement in human affairs. 
- It assures believers of His readiness to listen and respond with love and wisdom. God’s attentiveness is not passive but reflects His desire to be in communion with His creation. 
- It encourages faith, hope, and confidence in approaching Him, knowing that He values the prayers of the righteous.
- Recognizing that God’s ears are attentive reshapes how believers approach prayer. It invites them to come before Him with humility and sincerity, trusting that He listens with care. 
- This understanding also encourages a prayer life that is not merely about asking for things, but about seeking God's will and aligning one's heart with His. 
- It fosters a deeper relationship marked by dependence, trust, and a growing awareness of His presence and faithfulness.
- To embrace it is to draw near to God’s very presence. 

## What is God's Word Useful for? 

Referring back to the earlier passage from **2 Timothy**:

**2 Timothy 3:16**
> “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.”

- Here we learn what God's Word is useful for:
  - **Teaching** – Knowing What Is Right: The Bible gives us sound doctrine—clear instruction about Who God is, Who we are, What God has done through Jesus Christ and How we are to live in response. It helps us form a "biblical worldview" — which means a way of seeing life, morality, and eternity through God’s lens, not the world’s.  You can’t grow in truth without submitting to teaching from Scripture. 
  - **Useful for Rebuking** – Knowing What Is Wrong: God’s Word not only comforts, it confronts. Scripture exposes sin, convicts our hearts, and calls us to repentance. Like a mirror, it shows us where we fall short of God's standard (**James 1:23-25**). The Holy Spirit uses Scripture to lovingly say, “This must change.” Sometimes the most loving thing God can do is rebuke us, so we don’t stay in our sin.
  - **Useful for Correcting** – Getting Back on Track: Where rebuking exposes what’s wrong, correction shows us how to make it right. God doesn't just leave us in guilt — He gives us a way back to Him. The Bible redirects us — helping us unlearn sinful habits and embrace godly patterns. Like a GPS that recalculates your route, Scripture points you back to the right path. Correction is a sign of God’s grace, not His anger. He disciplines those He loves. 
  - **Useful for Training in Righteousness** – Staying on the Path: Training implies discipline, consistency, and purpose. The Bible trains us in how to live a life that pleases God. It builds spiritual endurance, strengthens our faith, and forms Christ-like character. Just like athletes train daily to compete, Christians must train daily in righteousness. Righteousness doesn’t happen by accident—it happens by training in truth. 


### The Holy Spirit Equips Us for Every Good Work

The Goal of Scripture: Paul concludes by stating that all of this—teaching, rebuking, correcting, training—serves a purpose: 

**2nd Timothy 3:17**
> “…so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.” 

- God’s Word prepares us not just to believe right but to **live right**. It equips us to serve, to love, to lead, and to endure. We are not just saved to sit — we are **saved to serve**. 
- If you want to hear God, learn His ways, walk in His will, and grow in Holiness—open your Bible. 
- It is the breath of God to your soul. It will teach you, correct you, train you, and prepare you for the life God has called you to live. 
- Spend daily time in the Word. Ask God to speak to you personally as you read. Let Scripture shape your thoughts, correct your habits, and fuel your mission. 


### The Holy Spirit Helps Us in Our Weakness

**Romans 8:26-27**
> 26 In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. 27 And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God.

- Paul tells us that the Spirit intercedes when we don’t know how to pray.
- This is part of a larger message of hope and glory during suffering.


**Romans 8:18**
> Our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory to be revealed." 

- Even in wordless groaning, God hears us through the Spirit. Have you ever felt something too deep to explain? The Spirit translates that to God. 
- The Holy Spirit Is Our Prayer Partner and Advocate: 

**John 16:7**
> But very truly I tell you, it is for your good that I am going away. Unless I go away, the Advocate will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you.

- Jesus said it was better for Him to leave so the Advocate could come. The Holy Spirit is not distant; He is present, like praying with a spouse or child. 
 
 **John 14:26**
 > But the Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and will remind you of everything I have said to you.
 
- The Spirit teaches and reminds us of Jesus’ words. He’s with us and in us, comforting and guiding. 

**Ephesians 1:13**
> And you also were included in Christ when you heard the message of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed, you were marked in him with a seal, the promised Holy Spirit

- The Holy Spirit seals us and marks us as God’s own.

**Ephesians 4:30**
> And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.

- We are sealed for the day of redemption. 

**2 Corinthians 1:21-22**
> Now it is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ. He anointed us, 22 set his seal of ownership on us, and put his Spirit in our hearts as a deposit, guaranteeing what is to come.

- God put His Spirit in our hearts as a deposit. This is spiritual ownership
- God is saying, “You are Mine.” That seal cannot be broken; it guarantees eternal security. 

### We Must Not Grieve the Holy Spirit: You can’t have intimacy without sensitivity

**Ephesians 4:30** 
> And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.

– We grieve the Spirit through willful sin. 

**Hebrews 10:26-29** 
> If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, 27 but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of God. 28 Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. 29 How much more severely do you think someone deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified them, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace?

– Rejecting God's grace insults the Spirit. If you’re sealed with the Spirit, your life should reflect that seal. 

- Are there areas in your life that dishonor the Spirit?  God is calling you to repentance and renewal:
- **Walking and Growing in the Spirit**: Growth is proof of life. No growth? Then there’s a problem. **Luke 2:52** – Even Jesus grew in wisdom and favor. **Galatians 5:16, 25** – Walk by the Spirit… keep in step with Him. 
- The Holy Spirit isn’t a force, He’s a person you walk with daily. 

**Jude 1:20**
> Build yourselves up… praying in the Holy Spirit.

- The Spirit Aligns Us With God’s Will: The Holy Spirit is not just a helper in your plans; He realigns your heart to God’s. 

**Romans 8:27**
> And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God.

– He intercedes “in accordance with the will of God.” When your spirit and His Spirit are united, you pray and live according to His purpose. This is how you discern God’s will in decisions, relationships, and life. 


### Are You Filled With the Holy Spirit?

**Ephesians 5:18**
> Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit

- This isn’t a one-time event. It’s a daily filling. Are you running on empty? Come be filled again. If you’ve received the Spirit, stir Him up. If not, seek God now – before it’s too late. 


Eternity Is a Long Time — Where Will You Spend It?

You were never meant to walk alone. The Holy Spirit is here to help. He prays with you, walks with you, speaks to you, and lives in you. 

**Romans 8:16**
> The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God’s children.

- The Spirit testifies that we are God’s children. Be one with the Holy Spirit. Walk in power. Live with a purpose.


### God Bless you all in The Mighty Name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth.
